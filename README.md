#LA Hacks 2021

## Inspiration

There have been many difficulties encountered during this pandemic. Local businesses, in particular, have been struggling to keep their business open, due to stay-at-home orders and indoor dining being limited. We wanted to find a way to help support those in our community and spread the word on their business to help them stay open a little longer.

## What it does

GoLocal is a website created to help find small businesses in your community. Users are able to enter what kind of store they are looking for and/or the area it is located in. They will be shown results based on their inputs to find a new place to visit.

## How we built it

The backend of the website was built using Python and Flask. The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We were able to retrieve local business data through the Yelp API. The design of the website was created on Figma.

## Challenges we ran into

Converting some of the design we had on Figma onto the actual website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a platform that helps local businesses and restaurants.

## What we learned

We learned more about Flask and Rest API's.

## What's next for GoLocal
We would like to include a Log in and Sign in page for returning users, so that they are able to save the businesses they enjoyed visiting or hope to visit. We would also like to include a page to view their saved locations.
